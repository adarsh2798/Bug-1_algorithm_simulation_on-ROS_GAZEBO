# Bug-1_algorithm_simulation_on-ROS_GAZEBO

In this project, BUG-1 algorithm was implemenetd in ROS-GAZEBO using TURTLEBOT. A sample gazebo world was chosen and simulation was performed where turtlebot reached the goal point using bug-1 algorithm.

# Basic Overview
The basic tasks to be carried out for bug-1 until goal is reached are:

1. Move towards goal in a staright line.

2. If an obstacle is encountered, circumnavigate the obstacle boundary fully
and go to the location on the boundary that is closest to goal and repeat
step(1).

Following is a image showing the path taken by turtlebot to reach goal during a simulation:
